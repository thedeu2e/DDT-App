# RL-Ryu-App
This repository is centered around creating an easily undrestandable, customizable Ryu Controller application for SDN to facilitate research utlizing reinforcement learning for autonomous applications in software defined networks. I have modifed the code from the repository https://github.com/stainleebakhla/mininet-flow-generator to use MGEN instead of iPerf to simulate realistic traffic traits.
